# Multi-threading

### *Project: Big Data Processing Using Multi-threading*

*Idea:*  
Develop an application to process and analyze large files (e.g., JSON/CSV with millions of records) using *multi-threading* to improve performance and reduce execution time.

---

### *Implementation Steps:*  
1. *Read Large Files:*  
   - Use BufferedReader or libraries like *Apache Commons CSV/OpenCSV* for CSV files, or *Jackson/Gson* for JSON files.  
2. *Split Data into Chunks:*  
   - Divide data into smaller chunks for parallel processing.  
3. *Process Data with Multi-threading:*  
   - Use ExecutorService, ThreadPool, Callable, and Future for parallel processing.  
   - Ensure thread safety with *Concurrent Collections* like ConcurrentHashMap.  
4. *Store Results:*  
   - Save processed data in a database like *MySQL* or *PostgreSQL*.  
5. *Generate Reports:*  
   - Provide insights (e.g., word frequency, financial analysis) via a *Spring Boot API*.

### *Technologies:*  
- *Java Multi-threading* (Executors, Callable, Future)  
- *Apache Commons CSV* or *OpenCSV*  
- *MySQL/PostgreSQL*  
- *Spring Boot* (for API)
